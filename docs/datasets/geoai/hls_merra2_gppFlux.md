| **Description** | Dataset Summary:<br>This dataset consists of Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 multispectral reflectance imagery and MERRA-2 observations centered around eddy covariance flux towers and the corresponding Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) data at the towers. Its purpose is to serve as a finetuning dataset for geospatial foundation models for the task of regressing GPP flux observations from HLS and MERRA-2 data.<br><br>Dataset Structure:<br>The dataset consists of:<br>(1) HLS 6-band Tiff files of dimension 50x50x6, with the center of the chip colocated with flux tower locations,<br>(2) 10-dimensional vector of MERRA-2 variables for each chip (1x1x10) recording temperature, soil moisture, heat flux, radiation, precipitation at the flux towers,<br>(3) Daily GPP data derived from the eddy covariance measurements using the night-time partitioning approach at 37 flux tower sites distributed globally spanning 2018 to 2021. There are a total of 975 instances. MERRA-2 data and GPP flux observations are recorded as csv files, with a row corresponding to each HLS chip.<br><br>HLS Band Order:<br>1, Blue, B02<br>2, Green, B03<br>3, Red, B04<br>4, NIR, B8A<br>5, SW 1, B11<br>6, SW 2, B12<br><br>MERRA-2 observations:<br>[M2T1NXSLV] T2MIN,<br>[M2T1NXSLV] T2MAX,<br>[M2T1NXSLV] T2MEAN,<br>[M2T1NXSLV] TSMDEWMEAN,<br>[M2T1NXLND] GWETROOT,<br>[M2T1NXLND] LHLAND,<br>[M2T1NXLND] SHLAND,<br>[M2T1NXLND] SWLAND,<br>[M2T1NXLND] PARDFLAND,<br>[M2T1NXLND] PRECTOTLAND<br><br>Data Splits:<br>The dataset consists of 975 chips and we split the dataset based on years to create train test splits. Given the relatively small size of the dataset, we use a leave-one-year-out-cross-validation approach to train and evaluate. The number of observations vary across years. In this repo, we have used three years for training and one year as test. |
