#Submit Jobs Using the Scheduler

[Week 2 Index](week2.md)

**Previous Section:** [What is a Cluster?](what_cluster.md)

In this section, we will discuss what a scheduler is and how to interact with it to get your work done.

First, what is a scheduler? We use a scheduler called **Slurm**, which is the most common one used by major computing centers. It is a resource manager and a workload manager. Essentially, there are a finite number of compute jobs, many users of the system, and even more jobs to be run. The scheduler tracks resource allocation requests and manages the execution of those jobs. Users package their work (directly or indirectly) into self-contained **shell scripts** submitted to Slurm.

So what is a `resource allocation request` or a `job`? It's essentially a shell script that encapsulates everything for the work to be done. This shell script can be submitted to the scheduler via the `sbatch` program. The details of what resources are requested are commonly inside the script itself, but can also be passed to the `sbatch` program manually.

Purdue's community clusters require a couple of pieces of information to actually submit a job. The first of which is what account to submit that job to.

Use the `slist` program to show which Slurm accounts are available for you to submit to:
```bash
$ slist
            Current Negishi Accounts                              
   ==============================================================================    
                  |              CPU Partition              |    AI Partition        
   Accounts       |   Total     Queue      Run      Free    |  GPU Hours Balance     
   ============== | ========= ========= ========= ========= | ===================    
   lab_queue      |       128        32        64        32 |                 0.0
```
!!! warning

    The `lab_queue` here is just a placeholder, in reality, this should be something similar to your PI's username. In the following examples, please substitute `lab_queue` with an account found in the output of `slist`.

!!! note "Empty `slist`"

    If your `slist` output is empty, that means you aren't associated with any groups that have resources allocated to their accounts on that cluster.

Once you know what account you want to submit with, you need to know what part of the cluster you want to submit that job to. To show the different partitions available on the cluster, run the `showpartitions` program:
```bash
$ showpartitions
Partition statistics for cluster negishi at Thu Jul 17 16:12:58 EDT 2025
Partition       #Nodes     #CPU_cores  Cores_pending   Job_Nodes MaxJobTime Cores Mem/Node
Name  State   Total  Idle  Total   Idle Resorc  Other   Min   Max  Day-hr:mn /node     (GB)
cpu      up     446     0  57088   2078      0  15973     1 infin   infinite   128     257
highmem  up       6     0    768    236      0   2114     1 infin   infinite   128    1031
gpu      up       5     3    160    132      0      0     1 infin   infinite    32     515
```
To see what the different node types mean, use the `sfeatures` program:
```bash
$ sfeatures
NODELIST    CPUS  MEMORY   AVAIL_FEATURES   GRES
a[000-449]  128   257400   A,a              (null)
b[000-005]  128   1031600  B,b              (null)
g[000-004]  32    515500   G,g,MI210,mi210  gpu:3
```
Use `AVAIL_FEATURES` as tags as a constraint on clusters with more distinct hardware types.

!!! tip

    Use the `-C` or `--constraint` option with `sbatch` to target one of the feature tags.

Lastly, something you may want to specify is the *Quality of Service* (QoS) for the job. This would include the `standby` QoS for jobs that you want to use idle resources and not the high-priority resources in your lab account.

For more information, see [Scheduler Modernization :octicons-link-external-16:](https://www.rcac.purdue.edu/news/7245).

Essentially, you need to specify an account to submit to and a part of the cluster you want to submit to. Sometimes, you may want to specify a QoS for your job as well.

Please use a command-line text editor to create this shell script, named `example.sh`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -A lab_queue -p cpu -q standby
#SBATCH -c 8 -t 00:01:00

module load conda
python example.py
```

??? note "Numpy again"

    If you ran into the *no module named numpy* error earlier, you will need to activate your conda environment inside your job as well:
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    #SBATCH -A lab_queue -p cpu -q standby
    #SBATCH -c 8 -t 00:01:00

    module load conda
    conda activate example
    python example.py
    ```

Once that is written, submit it to the scheduler with the `sbatch` program:
```bash
$ ls
example.py  example.sh  ...

$ sbatch example.sh
Submitted batch job 19804935
```
You have now submitted your first supercomputing resource allocation request. This job ID number is helpful to note down as it can be used elsewhere.

!!! tip

    The output of your job will, by default, be saved in files with this ID (e.g., `slurm-1980435.out`).

The job that we submitted requested 8 cores for 1 minute from your lab's account, to the CPU part of the cluster, using the `standby` QoS.

Following is a list of common Slurm resource parameters that you may want to specify in your shell script:

| Shortcut | Long form option | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `-A` | `--account` | Account (default: `lab_queue`) |
| `-p` | `--partition` | Partition (default: `cpu`) |
| `-q` | `--qos` | Quality of Service (default: none) |
| `-J` | `--job-name` | Job name (default: `<script name>`) |
| `-t` | `--time` | Walltime limit |
| `-N` | `--nodes` | Number of nodes (default: 1) |
| `-n` | `--ntasks`, `--ntasks-per-node` | Number of Slurm tasks |
| `-c` | `--cpus-per-task` | Number of CPUs per task |

You can also use the `man` program to learn more about these options.

You can use the `squeue` program to list currently scheduled (pending and running) jobs. By default it will show all jobs from all users on the cluster, which leads to a lot of output.

**Quiz:** What option do we need to limit the output to a specific account? Specific user? Only our own jobs?

??? note "Answer"

    Specific account: `squeue -A ACCOUNT_NAME`

    Specific user: `squeue -u USERNAME`

    Only our own jobs: `squeue --me`

To learn more about the parameters of a single job, you can use the `jobinfo` program. To use `jobinfo`, the command would be `jobinfo JOB_ID`, where the `JOB_ID` is replaced with the job ID mentioned above (which you can also check with the `squeue` program).


```bash
$ jobinfo 19804944
Name : example.sh
User : username
Account : lab_queue
Partition : cpu
Nodes : a305
...
```

There are also `jobenv`, `jobcmd`, and `jobscript` programs that tell you more information about the job as it was submitted.

!!! warning

    These four commands: `jobinfo`, `jobenv`, `jobcmd`, and `jobscript` are all RCAC-specific. It is not guaranteed that other HPC centers will have these programs implemented.

To cancel a job, use the `scancel` program. It is used by running `scancel <JOB_ID>`, where `<JOB_ID>` is replaced with the job ID mentioned before:
```bash
$ scancel 19804944
```
**Quiz:** Using the `man` program, what option do we need to cancel all our own jobs?

??? note "Answer"

    To cancel all our own jobs: `scancel --me`

!!! warning

    Cancelling an application this way isn't very "nice", in that it immediately stops everything and can cause problems if in the middle of file operations.

To get an interactive job (or essentially a shell on a compute node), use the `sinteractive` program (which is RCAC-specific). You will need to specify the same parameters as with `sbatch` (e.g., account, partition, QoS, cores, nodes, time):
```bash
username@login03.negishi:[~] $ sinteractive -A lab_queue -p cpu -q standby -c 4 -t 00:10:00
salloc: Pending job allocation 19809515
salloc: job 19809515 queued and waiting for resources
salloc: job 19809515 has been allocated resources
salloc: Granted job allocation 19809515
salloc: Waiting for resource configuration
salloc: Nodes a195 are ready for job
username@a195.negishi:[~] $
```
Notice that before the `sinteractive` program was run, we were on `login03.negishi`, and after it was run, we are now on `a195.negishi`. This is a good way to tell if you are running on a compute node or on a login node.

To get out of the interactive Slurm job, simply run the `exit` program, and you'll be returned to the login node you were on previously.

### Good Citizenship

Last but not least, there are four main points to touch on about good citizenship on HPC resources:

1. Do not request excessive resources knowingly (don't ask for a large memory node if it's not needed).
2. Do not abuse file systems (heavy I/O for `/depot` space; use `/scratch` instead).
3. Do not submit lots of tiny jobs; instead, use the pilot-job pattern with a workflow tool.
4. Do not submit jobs and camp (don't submit a GPU job from the Gateway for 24 hours so it's ready for you in the afternoon and then forget about it).
