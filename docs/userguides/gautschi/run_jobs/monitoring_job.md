Once a job is submitted there are several commands you can use to monitor the progress of the job.

To see your jobs, use the ```squeue -u``` command and specify your username:

(Remember, in our SLURM environment a queue is referred to as an 'Account')

```bash
squeue -u myusername

JOBID      USER     ACCOUNT      PART QOS     NAME       NODES TRES_PER_NODE   CPUS  TIME_LIMIT ST TIME
182792     myusername account_name     cpu  standby job1         1 N/A              192     4:00:00  R 35:54
185841     myusername account_name     cpu  normal  job2         1 N/A              192     4:00:00  R 36:51
185844     myusername account_name     smal normal  job3         1 gres/gpu:1        64     8:00:00  R 22:11
```

To retrieve useful information about your queued or running job, use the ```scontrol show job``` command with your job's ID number. The output should look similar to the following:

```bash
scontrol show job 3519

JobId=3519 JobName=job.sub
   UserId=myusername GroupId=mygroup MCS_label=N/A
   Priority=1000 Nice=0 Account=myaccount QOS=normal

```

There are several useful bits of information in this output.

- ```JobState``` lets you know if the job is Pending, Running, Completed, or Held.

- ```RunTime``` and ```TimeLimit``` will show how long the job has run and its maximum time.

- ```SubmitTime``` is when the job was submitted to the cluster.

- ```NumNodes```, ```NumCPUs```, ```NumTasks``` and ```CPUs/Task``` are the number of 
Nodes, CPUs, Tasks, and - CPUs per Task are shown.

- ```WorkDir``` is the job's working directory.
