/tmp directories are provided for short-term file storage only. Each front-end and compute node has a ```/tmp``` directory. Your program may write temporary data to the /tmp directory of the compute node on which it is running. That data is available for as long as your program is active. Once your program terminates, that temporary data is no longer available. When used properly, /tmp may provide faster local storage to an active process than any other storage option. You should use your home directory and Fortress for longer-term storage or for holding critical results.

Backups are not performed for the ```/tmp``` directory and removes files from ```/tmp``` whenever space is low or whenever the system needs a reboot. In the event of a disk crash or file purge, files in ```/tmp``` are **not recoverable**. You should copy any important files to more permanent storage.
