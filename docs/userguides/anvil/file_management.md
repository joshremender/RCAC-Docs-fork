## File Systems

Anvil provides users with separate home, scratch, and project areas for managing files. These will be accessible via the `$HOME`, `$SCRATCH`, `$PROJECT` and `$WORK` environment variables. Each file system is available from all Anvil nodes but has different purge policies and ideal use cases (see table below). Users in the same allocation will share read and write access to the data in the `$PROJECT` space. The project space will be created for each allocation. `$PROJECT` and `$WORK` variables refer to the same location and can be used interchangeably.

`$SCRATCH` is a high-performance, internally resilient GPFS parallel file system with 10 PB of usable capacity, configured to deliver up to 150 GB/s bandwidth. The scratch filesystems are for limited-duration, high-performance storage of data for running jobs or workflows and are explicitly not intended to be used as a long-term storage. Doing so, or engaging in measures to circumvent purging, is adversely affecting all users of the system and is prohibited.

Files in scratch directories are not recoverable. Files in scratch directories are not backed up. **If you accidentally delete a file, a disk crashes, or old files are purged, they cannot be restored.**

Anvil File Systems

| File System | Mount Point | Quota | Snapshots | Purpose | Purge policy |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Anvil ZFS | /home | 25 GB | Full schedule\* | Home directories: area for storing personal software, scripts, compiling, editing, etc. | Not purged |
| Anvil ZFS | /apps | N/A | Weekly\* | Applications |  |
| Anvil GPFS | /anvil | N/A | No |  |  |
| Anvil GPFS | /anvil/scratch | 100 TB | No | User scratch: area for job I/O activity, temporary storage | Files older than 30-day (access time) will be purged |
| Anvil GPFS | /anvil/projects | 5 TB | Full schedule\* | Per allocation: area for shared data in a project, common datasets and software installation | Not purged while allocation is active. Removed 90 days after allocation expiration |
| Anvil GPFS | /anvil/datasets | N/A | Weekly\* | Common data sets (not allocated to users) |  |

\* Full schedule keeps nightly snapshots for 7 days, weekly snapshots for 3 weeks, and monthly snapshots for 2 months.

### Useful tools

To check the quota of different file systems, type `myquota` at the command line.

```
x-anvilusername@login03.anvil:[~] $myquota

Type     Location          Size       Limit      Use     Files    Limit    Use
==============================================================================
home     x-anvilusername   261.5MB    25.0GB     1%       -       -        - 
scratch  anvil             6.3GB      100.0TB    0.01%    3k      1,048k   0.36%
projects accountname1      37.2GB     5.0TB      0.73%    403k    1,048k   39%

```

## Transferring Files

Anvil supports several methods for file transfer to and from the system. Users can transfer files between Anvil and Linux-based systems or Mac using either `scp` or `rsync`. Windows SSH clients typically include scp-based file transfer capabilities.

### SCP

{% set hostname = "anvil" %}

{{ scp_snippet( hostname ) }}

### Rsync

--8<-- "docs/snippets/rsync.md"

### SFTP

{% set hostname = "anvil" %}

{{ sftp_snippet( hostname ) }}

### Globus

--8<-- "docs/snippets/globus.md"

## Lost File Recovery

Your **HOME** and **PROJECTS** directories on Anvil are protected against accidental file deletion through a series of snapshots taken every night just after midnight. Each snapshot provides the state of your files at the time the snapshot was taken. It does so by storing only the files which have changed between snapshots. A file that has not changed between snapshots is only stored once but will appear in every snapshot. This is an efficient method of providing snapshots because the snapshot system does not have to store multiple copies of every file.

These snapshots are kept for a limited time at various intervals. Please refer to [Anvil File Systems](#file-systems) to see the frequency of generating snapshots on different mount points. Anvil keeps nightly snapshots for 7 days, weekly snapshots for 3 weeks, and monthly snapshots for 2 months. This means you will find snapshots from the last 7 nights, the last 3 Sundays, and the last 2 first of the months. Files are available going back between two and three months, depending on how long ago the last first of the month was. Snapshots beyond this are not kept.

**Only files which have been saved during an overnight snapshot are recoverable.** If you lose a file the same day you created it, the file is **not** recoverable because the snapshot system has not had a chance to save the file.

**Snapshots are not a substitute for regular backups.** It is the responsibility of the researchers to back up any important data to long-term storage space. Anvil **does** protect against hardware failures or physical disasters through other means however these other means are also **not** substitutes for backups.

Purdue RCAC offers several ways for researchers to access snapshots of their files.

### flost

If you know when you lost the file, the easiest way is to use the `flost` command.

To run the tool you will need to specify the location where the lost file was with the `-w` argument:

```
$ flost -w /home

This script will help you try to recover lost home or group directory contents.
NB: Scratch directories are not backed up and cannot be recovered.

Currently anchoring the search under:  /home
If your lost files were on a different filesystem, exit now with Ctrl-C and
rerun flost with a suitable '-w WHERE' argument (or see 'flost -h' for help).

Please enter the date that you lost your files:  MM/DD/YYYY

The closest recovery snapshot to your date of loss currently available is from
MM/DD/YYYY 12:00am.  First, you will need to SSH to a dedicated
service host zfs.anvil.rcac.purdue.edu, then change your directory
to the snapshot location:
    $ ssh zfs.anvil.rcac.purdue.edu
    $ cd /home/.zfs/snapshot/zfs-auto-snap_daily-YYYY-MM-DD-0000
    $ ls

Then copy files or directories from there back to where they belong:
    $ cp mylostfile /home
    $ cp -r mylostdirectory /home
```

Here is an example of `/home` directory. If you know more specifically where the lost file was you may provide the full path to that directory.

This tool will prompt you for the date on which you lost the file or would like to recover the file from. If the tool finds an appropriate snapshot it will provide instructions on how to search for and recover the file.

If you are not sure what date you lost the file you may try entering different dates into the `flost` to try to find the file or you may also **manually browse** the snapshots in `/home/.zfs/snapshot` folder for **Home** directory and `/anvil/projects/.snapshots` folder for **Projects** directory.
